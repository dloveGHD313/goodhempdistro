# CODEX RULES (Good Hemp Distros)

You are working in a Next.js app repo.

Non-negotiables:
1) Do not ask me what to do next. Use the active task list below.
2) Always fix the smallest blocking issue first.
3) Keep build + tests green after every chunk of work.
4) Commit in small clean commits with clear messages.
5) Never change routes or remove pages without saying exactly why.
6) When dealing with assets, verify the URL works in prod (Vercel) before moving on.

Active task order (do in this order):
A) Logo must load in production at /brand/goodhempdistrologo.png (no 404).
B) Theme/colors must match brand.ts and the screenshots vibe (dark navy + lime + orange CTAs).
C) Finish “subscriptions + affiliate + vendor packages” flows (tables + seed + admin edit later).
