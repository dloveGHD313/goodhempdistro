# GHD Mascot Assets

## Placeholder Asset Paths
These paths are wired into the mascot system and must exist for final production polish.

- `/public/mascot/jax/idle.png`
- `/public/mascot/ledger/idle.png`
- `/public/mascot/miles/idle.png`
- `/public/mascot/atlas/idle.png`

If any file is missing, the UI falls back to `/public/brand/goodhempdistrologo.png`.

## Notes
- Use the provided mascot style reference (cartoon, playful, confident, modern GHD vibe).
- Keep file names and folder structure identical to avoid breaking the build.
